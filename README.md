Introduction:
Code Refactoring is the act of improving prexisting (legacy) code without changing the code's function. Advantage of code refactoring is that it lowers the maintenance cost of the code while still being usable in newer technologies.

The Project's Aim:
A marketing agency wants a codebase that meets accessibility standards and that their own site is optimized for search engines.

Technologies used:
 * HTML
 * CSS

The Acceptance Criteria:
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
  THEN I find semantic HTML elements (done) -- added articles, sections
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
    THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning (done)
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
  THEN I find accessible alt attributes (done) -- added alt description of the pictues if images do not render
WHEN I view the heading attributes
  THEN they fall in sequential order (done)
WHEN I view the title element
  THEN I find a concise, descriptive title (done) -- title has descriptive key words that SEOs use to pull up
